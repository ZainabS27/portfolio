    Hi! I'm a junior at <strong>Lehigh University</strong> majoring in <strong>Computer Science</strong> with a minor in <strong>Business</strong>.
    I'm passionate about building reliable, user-focused technology and am actively working to grow both my <strong>frontend</strong> and <strong>backend</strong> development skills.
</p>
<p>
    Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge in the areas of <strong>Agentic AI</strong> and <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong> servers, with a particular interest in how these systems can be applied to intelligent software and automation.
</p>
<p>
    This semester, I'm taking courses in <strong>Software Engineering</strong>, <strong>Blockchain Algorithms</strong>, <strong>Computer Architecture</strong>, <strong>Systems Administration</strong>, and <strong>Financial</strong> and <strong>Managerial Accounting</strong> to round out my technical and business expertise. I also am continuing to utilize my experience interning on the <strong>DevOps</strong> team at Fiserv, a global fintech and payments company, to enhance my understanding of software development and deployment processes.
